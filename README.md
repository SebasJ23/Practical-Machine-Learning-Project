# Practical-Machine-Learning-Project
This repository contains the final project for the course Practical Machine Learning on Coursera.
To see the final report for the project you have several options:
1. Clone this repository and run the file "Course Project.Rmd" locally on your machine. However, depending on the number of cores you have available, the process may take a while (It took me a little over 15 min with 4 cores on )
2. Check the "Course_Project.md" directly on github.
3. Check the html version of the project created with gh-pages [here](http://sebasj23.github.io/Practical-Machine-Learning-Project/Course_Project.html).
